# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
The ability to detect fraudulent transactions is of critical importance to all credit card companies. In this project, we classify credit card transactions as authentic or fraudulent based on the data regarding time, amount and a set of PCA-transformed features for a large number of transactions. We explore the data extensively and employ different techniques to build classification models, which are compared through various evaluation metrics.
